## TEACHING PHILOSOPHY

As a therapist venturing into teaching, my philosophy is rooted in the belief that education, like therapy, thrives on empathy, respect, and authenticity. In my classroom, I aim to center student needs, ensuring that my teaching style and content are attuned to their developmental stages and individual learning styles. I strive to create a warm, inclusive environment that encourages students to explore and express their thoughts and emotions without fear of judgment. Recognizing the limits of my own expertise, I approach teaching with humility, inviting collaboration and dialogue that enrich both my students' learning and my own growth. At the same time, I am committed to providing the structure and support necessary to guide students through their academic journey, empowering them to build confidence and achieve their educational goals.
