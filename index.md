Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the [Counseling Psychology program (APA-accredited)](https://education.uiowa.edu/areas-study/counseling-and-mental-health/counseling-psychology) under the mentorship of [Dr. Martin Kivlighan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eOy2ZCkAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Before that, I earned my M.S. in [Clinical Mental Health Counseling (CACREP)](https://www.smu.edu/simmons/academics/counseling/ms-counseling) from Southern Methodist University and B.S. in [Clinical Psychology](https://www.fjmu.edu.cn/) from Fujian Medical University.

My broad research goal is to advance knowledge of what makes psychotherapy work, and the cultural factors that hinder or enrich the psychotherapy experience for culturally diverse clients.

Outside of work, I am an angler ðŸŽ£ and enjoy spending time in nature camping â›º or hiking ðŸ¥¾.
