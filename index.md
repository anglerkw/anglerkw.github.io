My name is Kun Wang. I am a second-year doctoral student in the counseling psychology program under the mentorship of Dr. Martin Kivlighan( https://education.uiowa.edu/directory/martin-kivlighan). My broad research goal is to advance knowledge of what makes psychotherapy work, and the cultural factors that hinder or enrich the psychotherapy experience for culturally diverse clients.
