Hi, I am a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the counseling psychology program under the mentorship of Dr. Martin Kivlighan. My broad research goal is to advance knowledge of what makes psychotherapy work, and the cultural factors that hinder or enrich the psychotherapy experience for culturally diverse clients.
