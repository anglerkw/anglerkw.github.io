title: "My Approach to Psychotherapy"
---
## Clinical Interests:

I primarily approach counseling from a time limited psychodynamic lens which means that I focus on the way how client relate to themselves and others. It also means that I actively seek to provide a therapy relationship with clients that, serves as a vehicle for new experiences and new understandings. [...]<details>
In another word, many times, client’s problem, pain, or difficulties are rooted in their relationships with others and how they have come to see themselves. Most of them have some patterns that they fall back on when they interact with people. Usually, people develop those patterns for good reasons, and they served them well at a particular point in their lives. However, sometimes they might start to feel stuck in a particular way of thinking about themselves and their relationships that doesn't work well for them anymore. In order to get unstuck and develop a new way of relating that would work them, I will work with clients to examine these patterns and also attend carefully to them in therapeutic relationship between client and me, meaning that the interactions between therapist and client will be used to understand the interactions between client and others. For example, I will bring my reactions from time to time for therapeutic use. </details>


## Multicultural Interests:

I believe that individuals are experts on their own experience, and that their communities offer wisdom about valued living. To understand the sociohistorical contexts and culture of communities, I actively seek opportunities beyond therapy sessions to gain more comprehensive knowledge about the complexity and needs of the clients’ communities. I am interested in working with clients on a variety of concerns related to identity and culture. I have strong interest and commitment to working with our LGBTQ+ communities, Asian American/Asian /International students.
